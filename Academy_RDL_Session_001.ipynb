    "[Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. In order to be run on any one machine, it first has to be installed; you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For more info on Python, I'd strongly suggest watching [this YouTube video series](https://pythonprogramming.net/python-fundamental-tutorials/)."

There are many out there, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download); but I will use [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html), as it allows us to use Notebooks in which we write code 'cells' and text 'cells' next to each other, helping me explain what happens in each code cell.

    "There are many programming languages out there. Some are similar to Python but are built with different use-cases in mind, e.g.(*exempli gratia*): [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) was made for mathematicians and statisticians in mind. Some are 'lower-level'; what's meant by this is that the code written in these languages are 'closer to the silicone', in that they instruct computer chips what to do in a more direct manner. These 'lower-level' languages such as [C](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-the-c-programming-language-beginner-tutorial/), [C++](https://isocpp.org/get-started) or even [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html) tend to be harder to use. An example of dificulties that can be found in 'lower-level' languages and not in Python or R is 'momory management'; in Python, we can assign any object a value without having to tell the computer minute details about the object (e.g.: its anticipated memory size, its address in memory (such as RAM or [DiskDrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive))), e.g.:"

    "Our API landscape has changed a lot through the years.

You can find all API-related details on the [Developer Portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en) and its [Q&A](https://community.developers.refinitiv.com/), but [here](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/summary-of-common-lseg-refinitiv-apis) is a shallow dive into the Refinitiv Data Library's landscape:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eikon Desktop App and Workspace Desktop App\n",
    "\n",
    "1st, a little refresh on the two ‘products’ (in the classical sense of the word) Refinitiv sells: (I) [Eikon Desktop App](https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/eikon-trading-software?utm_content=TR%20Brand%20Product-UKI-EMEA-G-EN-BMM&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=596228_PaidSearchTradingandBankingBAU&elqCampaignId=16981&utm_term=%20+thomson%20+eikon&gclid=Cj0KCQjwguGYBhDRARIsAHgRm49_cPxx8gcyCZMFDms7U7culQF9nMF6qNjl5Aoy_INB2GFSyhy30BUaAuWzEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&_ga=2.91796954.1111853358.1688972213-1243864833.1674474112) and (II) [Workspace Desktop App](https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/refinitiv-workspace/download-workspace?_ga=2.91796954.1111853358.1688972213-1243864833.1674474112). Desktop apps differ from other applications in that they have to be downloaded and installed on your machine to work; one cannot, for example, access it on a web-page. They exist in contrast to their Web Apps; more on this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I. Eikon Desktop App is a desktop application that only works on Windows. It is a [GUI](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gui.htm#:~:text=A%20GUI%20(graphical%20user%20interface)%20is%20a%20system%20of%20interactive,the%20user%20interacts%20with%20them.) that allows you to access many databases with buttons to click instead of lines of code one would have to write and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "II. Workspace Desktop App is basically Eikon Desktop App version 2. It is a desktop application that works on Windows and Mac. We are still in the process of onboarding all our datasets on that app, meaning that some (but few) datasets viewable on the Eikon Desktop App are not yet viewable on the Workspace Desktop App (e.g.: certain commodities landing pages that summarizes a lot of information in one place). On the other hand, we are also onboarding new datasets all the time, as per the nature of our company, and we tend to only make these new datasets viewable on the Workspace Desktop App, so as to not duplicate our work onboarding them on two apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a license that allows you to download and use the Eikon Desktop App, then by default your license will allow you access to the Workspace Desktop App too, and vice-versa. However, you may not have licenses to see all datasets available on either/both platforms (e.g.: you may not have a license with ‘real time data’ permissions, meaning that these datasets — and GUIs (e.g.: [graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC8aAk_ledc)) — will not show up on your App).\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B.: While some data providers are incorporated into our Apps and [APIs](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api), they might require you to pay them directly and get a license with them directly (e.g.: if you would like MSCI dataset access on Refinitiv Apps, you will need an MSCI license with MSCI separate from any Refinitiv license you may have).\n",
    "\n",
    "As per popular demand, we’ve made web versions of both of these desktop applications: Eikon Web and Workspace Web, both accessible via this [link](https://eikon.thomsonreuters.com/index.html), for which training can be found [here](https://my.refinitiv.com/content/mytr/en/policies/training-portal/refinitivworkspacenew/refinitivworkspacewebaccess.html?_ga=2.59282029.1111853358.1688972213-1243864833.1674474112). These are, by definition, not desktop applications, but web applications instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Eikon and Workspace Apps have their own APIs, more on this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find most of our datasets in our Workspace APIs — a.k.a.: Refinitiv Data (RD) libraries — be it with the [RD .Net](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-library-for--net), [RD TypeScript](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-library-for-python), or [RD Python](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-library-for-python) APIs or the [‘RefinitivR’ package](https://github.com/GreenGrassBlueOcean/RefinitivR). RD can only be used with one of two sessions called ‘desktop’ and ‘platform’. When using the desktop session, one needs to have either their Eikon Desktop App or their Workspace Desktop App running on the machine on which the API is being used; this is not required when using the platform session.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. When using the desktop session, the only credential needed to access Refinitiv datasets is your app key, information for which can be found [here](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/eikon/eikon-data-api/quick-start); this is because the desktop app handles all other credentials to authenticate you to the Refinitiv system.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. When using the platform session, one needs their App Key and user login & password.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on session handling in Python can be found [here](https://github.com/Refinitiv-API-Samples/Example.DataLibrary.Python/blob/main/Examples/4-Session/EX-4.01.01-Sessions.ipynb) (N.B.: more about the configuration file on the [Python RD Lib.

You will find great example uses on [GitHub](https://github.com/Refinitiv-API-Samples/Example.DataLibrary.Python/tree/main) and on [Articles](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog), but they are only a small set of possible use-cases and examples. That's where documentation comes into play! You can find the documentation [here](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-library-for-python/documentation), and also in the [docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) that you can find in this way:"
